## Welcome to 3DGE 64

3DGE 64 is a Doom 2 modification for the EDGE source port. It is a project in the style of Doom 64, however it is not created as a total conversion of Doom 64. For more "faithful" renditions of Doom 64, please check out Doom 64: Absolution for the Doomsday Engine, Doom 64: Retribution for GZDOOM, and Brutal Doom 64 for the GZDOOM engine. This project will come packaged with user-created levels tuned to challenge any demon slayer.
